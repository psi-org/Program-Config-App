# PROGRAM CONFIGURATION APP

This app can be used by anyone who wants to configure Tracker programs easily, providing many configuration tools in one place. The workflow has been redesigned to make it easier for users to set up programs from scratch without worrying about missing program components (such as Data Elements, Option Sets, etc.). Also, the app supports the creation of HNQIS 2.0 programs, providing several tools for the countries to develop Assessment checklists. The app interacts directly with the DHIS2 API, ensuring the integrity of the data that is consumed/provided by the users. A vast amount of validations has been implemented to avoid conflicts with the DHIS2 core and the app constantly syncs with the available metadata in the server. It mainly requires a constant connection to the internet and can be installed in any DHIS2 server with version 2.36 or later.
