### Introduction
The Program Config App (PCA) can be used as a generic DHIS2 Program Configuration wizard that simplifies the process of creating, editing, and maintaining DHIS2 programs and all related metadata. Users are presented with a unified interface from which they can add pre-existing or new Data Elements or Attributes to a Program individually or in bulk, add or edit Options Sets, apply Organisation Units access, configure Sharing Settings for multiple objects, as well as Import and Export Program configurations, and much more.

Also, the PCA fully automates the configuration of clinical quality improvement checklists based on PSI's HNQIS (Health Network Quality Improvement System) methodology.

This repository contains all the source code for the PCA, which is built using the DHIS2 App Platform and DHIS2 CLI. The PCA is being actively developed and has planned support for several years to come.

### Usage and Installation

For in depth instructions on how to use and install the PCA on your DHIS2 instance please refer to the [Program Configuration App Documentation](https://psi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PCA/overview).
